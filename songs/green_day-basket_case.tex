\beginverse

%\nolyrics Intro: \[G]


Do you have the time To listen to me whine?
About nothing and everything All at once
I am one of those Melodramatic fools
Neurotic to the bone No doubt about it
\endverse

\beginverse
Sometimes I give myself the creeps
Sometimes my mind plays tricks on me
It all keeps adding up
I think I'm cracking up
Am I just paranoid?
Am I just stoned?
\endverse

\beginverse
I went to a shrink To analyze my dreams
She says it's lack of sex That's bringing me down
I went to a whore He said my life's a bore
So quit my whining cause It's bringing her down
\endverse

\beginverse
Sometimes I give myself the creeps
Sometimes my mind plays tricks on me
It all keeps adding up
I think I'm cracking up
Am I just paranoid?
Uh, yuh, yuh, ya
\endverse

\beginverse
Grasping to control
So I better hold on
\endverse

\beginverse
Sometimes I give myself the creeps
Sometimes my mind plays tricks on me
It all keeps adding up
I think I'm cracking up
Am I just paranoid?
Am I just stoned?
\endverse
