\beginverse
\[Bm]Sometimes I feel
Like I don't have a partner
Sometimes I feel
Like my only friend
Is the city I live in
The city of angels
Lonely as I am
Together we cry
\endverse

\beginverse
I drive on her streets
Cause she's my companion
I walk through her hills
Cause she knows who I am
She sees my good deeds
And she kisses me windy
I never worry
Now that is a lie
\endverse

\beginchorus
[2x]
I don't ever want to feel
Like I did that day
Take me to the place I love
Take me all the way
\endchorus

\beginverse
It's hard to believe
That there's nobody out there
It's hard to believe
That I'm all alone
At least I have her love
The city she loves me
Lonely as I am
Together we cry
\endverse

\beginchorus
[2x]
I don't ever want to feel
Like I did that day
Take me to the place I love
Take me all the way
\endchorus

\beginverse
Under the bridge downtown
Is where I drew some blood
Under the bridge downtown
I could not get enough
Under the bridge downtown
Forgot about my love
Under the bridge downtown
I gave my life away
\endverse
