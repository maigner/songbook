\beginverse
Talk to me softly
There's something in your eyes
Don't hang your head in sorrow
And please don't cry
I know how you feel inside I've
I've been there before
Somethin' is changin' inside you
And don't you know
\endverse

\beginchorus
Don't you cry tonight I still love you baby. Don't you cry tonight
Don't you cry tonight there's a heaven above you baby
And don't you cry tonight
\endchorus




\beginverse
Give me a whisper
And give me a sigh
Give me a kiss before you
Tell me goodbye
Don't you take it so hard now
And please don't take it so bad
I'll still be thinkin' of you
And the times we had...     Baby
\endverse

\beginchorus
And don't you cry...
\endchorus

\beginchorus
Solo
\endchorus

\beginverse
And please remember
That I never lied
And please remember
How I felt inside now honey
You gotta make it your own way
But you'll be alright now sugar
You'll feel better tomorrow
Come the morning light now baby
\endverse

\beginchorus
And don't you cry tonight
And don't you cry tonight
And don't you cry tonight there's a heaven above you baby
And don't you cry
Don't you ever cry
Don't you cry tonight
Baby maybe someday
Don't you cry
Don't you ever cry
Don't you cry tonight
\endchorus
