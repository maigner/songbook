\beginsong{Knocking On Heavens Door}[
	by={Bob Dylan}]

\beginverse
Mama, take this badge off of me
I can't use it anymore.
It's gettin' dark, too dark to see
I feel I'm knockin' on heaven's door.
\endverse

\beginchorus
Knock, knock, knocking on heavens door...
\endchorus

\beginverse
Mama, put my guns in the ground
I can't shoot them anymore.
That long black cloud is comin' down
I feel I'm knockin' on heaven's door.
\endverse

\beginchorus
Knock, knock, knocking on heavens door...
\endchorus
