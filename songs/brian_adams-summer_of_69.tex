\endverse



\beginverse
\[D]    I got my first real six-string
\[A]     Bought it at the five-and-dime
\[D]     Played 'til my fingers bled
\[A]    It was summer of '69
\endverse


\beginverse
\[D]    Me and some guys from school
\[A]    Had a Band and we tried real hard
\[D]    Jimmy quit and Jody got married
\[A] I shoulda known we'd never get far
\endverse

\beginverse
\[Bm]       Oh when I \[A]look back now
\[D]       That was seemes to \[G]last forever
\[Bm]       And if I \[A]had the choice
\[D]       Ya - I'd always \[G]wanna be there
\[Bm]        Those were the \[A]best days of my life
\endverse

\beginverse
       Ain't no use in complainin'
       When you got a job to do
        Spent my evenin's down at the drive in
       And that's when I met you
\endverse


\beginverse
\[Bm]       Standin on a \[A]mama's porch
\[D]       You told me that you'd wait \[G]forever
\[Bm]       Oh and when you h\[A]eld my hand
\[D]       I knew that it was \[G]now or never
\[Bm]       Those were the b\[A]est days of my l\[D]ife
     (Oh yeah)           Back in the summer of \[D]69â€™\[A]
\endverse


\beginverse
\[F]        Man we were k\[B&]illin' time
We were y\[C]oung and restless
We n\[B&]eeded to unwind
\[F]         I guess n\[B&]othin' can last for\[C]ever, forever no

      I think about ya wonder what went wrong
