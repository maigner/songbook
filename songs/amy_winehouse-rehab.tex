\beginsong{Rehab}[
	by={Amy Winehouse}]

\beginchorus
They tr\[C]ied to make me go to rehab but I said, ``No, no, no.''
Yes, I've been black but when I come back you'll know, know, know
\[G]I ain't got the time and if my d\[F]addy thinks I'm fine
He's tr\[C]ied to make me go to r\[F]ehab but I won't \[C] go, go, go
\endchorus

\beginverse
\[E]I'd rather be at home with r\[a]ay
\[F]I ain't got seventy d\[Ab]ays
Cause there's n\[E]othing
There's nothing you can t\[a]each me
That \[F]I can't learn from Mr H\[Ab]athaway
I d\[G]idn't get a lot in class
But I kn\[F]ow it don't come in a shot glass
\endverse

\beginchorus
They tried to make me go to rehab but I said, ``No, no, no.''
Yes, I've been black but when I come back you'll know, know, know
I ain't got the time and if my daddy thinks I'm fine
He's tried to make me go to rehab but I won't go, go, go
\endchorus

\beginverse
The man said, ``Why do you think you're here?''
I said, ``I got no idea
I'm gonna, I'm gonna lose my baby
So I always keep a bottle near.''
He said, ``I just think you're depressed,
Kiss me, yeah baby, and go rest.''
\endverse

\beginchorus
They tried to make me go to rehab but I said, ``No, no, no.''
Yes, I've been black but when I come back you'll know, know, know
\endchorus

\beginverse
I don't ever wanna drink again
I just, ooh, I just need a friend
I'm not gonna spend ten weeks
Have everyone think I'm on the mend

It's not just my pride
It's just 'til these tears have dried
\endverse

\beginchorus
They tried to make me go to rehab but I said, ``No, no, no.''
Yes, I've been black but when I come back you'll know, know, know
I ain't got the time and if my daddy thinks I'm fine
He's tried to make me go to rehab but I won't go, go, go
