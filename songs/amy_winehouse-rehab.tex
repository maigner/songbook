\beginsong{Rehab}[
	by={Amy Winehouse}]

\beginchorus
They tried to make me go to rehab but I said, ``No, no, no.''
Yes, I've been black but when I come back you'll know, know, know
I ain't got the time and if my daddy thinks I'm fine
He's tried to make me go to rehab but I won't go, go, go
\endchorus
\beginverse
I'd rather be at home with ray
I ain't got seventy days
Cause there's nothing
There's nothing you can teach me
That I can't learn from Mr Hathaway

I didn't get a lot in class
But I know it don't come in a shot glass
\endverse

\beginchorus
They tried to make me go to rehab but I said, ``No, no, no.''
Yes, I've been black but when I come back you'll know, know, know
I ain't got the time and if my daddy thinks I'm fine
He's tried to make me go to rehab but I won't go, go, go
\endchorus

\beginverse
The man said, ``Why do you think you're here?''
I said, ``I got no idea
I'm gonna, I'm gonna lose my baby
So I always keep a bottle near.''
He said, ``I just think you're depressed,
Kiss me, yeah baby, and go rest.''
\endverse

\beginchorus
They tried to make me go to rehab but I said, ``No, no, no.''
Yes, I've been black but when I come back you'll know, know, know
\endchorus

\beginverse
I don't ever wanna drink again
I just, ooh, I just need a friend
I'm not gonna spend ten weeks
Have everyone think I'm on the mend

It's not just my pride
It's just 'til these tears have dried
\endverse

\beginchorus
They tried to make me go to rehab but I said, ``No, no, no.''
Yes, I've been black but when I come back you'll know, know, know
I ain't got the time and if my daddy thinks I'm fine
He's tried to make me go to rehab but I won't go, go, go
\endchorus
