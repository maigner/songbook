\beginverse
\[Am]Gettin' born in the st\[G]ate of Mississippi
\[Dm]Papa was a copper and her m\[Am]ama was a hippie
In Alabama she was swinging hammer
Price you gotta pay when you pick the panorama
She never knew that there was anything more than poor
What in the world does your company take me for?
\endverse

\beginverse
Black bandana, sweet Louisiana
Robbin' on a bank in the state of Indiana
She's a runner, rebel and a stunner
Hunt em everywhere saying baby whatcha gonna
Lookin' down the barrel of a hot metal .45
Just another way to survive
\endverse

\beginchorus
\[F]California rest in p\[Dm]eace
Simultaneous release
California show your teeth
She's my priestess, I'm your priest
Yeah, yeah
\endchorus

\beginverse
She's a lover, baby and a fighter
Should've seen her coming when it got a little brighter
With a name like Dani California
Day was gonna come when I was gonna mourn ya
\endverse

\beginverse
A little loaded she was stealing another breath
I love my baby to death
\endverse

\beginchorus
California rest in peace
Simultaneous release
California show your teeth
She's my priestess, I'm your priest
Yeah, yeah
\endchorus

\beginverse
\[Bm]Who knew the \[G]other s\[D]ide of you? Who knew what others died to prove?
Too true to say goodbye to you. Too true, too say say say...
\endverse

\beginverse
Push the fader, gifted animator
One for the now and eleven for the later
Never made it up to Minnesota
North Dakota man was a gunnin' for the quota
Down in the badlands she was saving the best for last
It only hurts when I laugh
Gone too fast
\endverse

\beginchorus
California rest in peace
Simultaneous release
California show your teeth
She's my priestess, I'm your priest
Yeah, yeah
2x
\endchorus
