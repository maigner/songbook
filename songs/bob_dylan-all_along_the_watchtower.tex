\beginverse
``There must be some kind of way out of here''
Said the joker to the thief
``There's too much confusion
I can't get no relief
\endverse

\beginverse
Businessmen they drink my wine
Plowmen dig my earth
None of them along the line
Know what any of it is worth''
\endverse

\beginverse
``No reason to get excited''
The thief, he kindly spoke
``There are many here among us
Who feel that life is but a joke
\endverse

\beginverse
But you and I, we've been through that
And this is not our fate
So let us not talk falsely now
The hour is getting late''
\endverse

\beginverse
\nolyrics Solo: \[Am] \[G] \[F] \[G]
\endverse

\beginchorus
All along the watchtower
Princes kept the view
While all the women came and went
Barefoot servants, too
\endchorus

\beginchorus
But outside in the cold distance
A wildcat did growl
Two riders were approaching
And the wind began to howl
\endchorus
