\beginverse
Cleaned a lot of plates in Memphis,  
pumped a lot of pain down in New
Orleans,  But I never saw the good side of the city, 
till I hitched a ride on a river boat queen. 
Big wheel a-keep on turnin,  
Proud  Mary keep on burnin,  
roll - in, rollin, rollin on the river.
\endverse


\beginverse
If you come down to the river, 
bet you're gonna find some people who live,
you don't have to worry, cause you have no money, 
people on the river are happy to give.  
Big wheel keep on turnin, 
Proud  Mary keep on burnin,
roll - in,  rollin,  rollin on the river.
