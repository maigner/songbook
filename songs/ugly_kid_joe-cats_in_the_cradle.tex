\beginverse
My \[A]child arrived just the \[G]other day
\[A]Came to the world in the \[E]usual way
There were \[]planes to catch, \[G]bills to pay
\[A]He learned to walk while I \[E]was away
He was \[D]talking 'fore I knew it, and as he grew
He'd say \[G]"I'm gonna be like \[E]you, dad,
\[G]You know I'm gonna be like \[E]you
\endverse

\beginchorus
And the \[E]cats in the cradle and the \[G]silver spoon
\[G]Little boy blue and a \[A]man on the moon
\[E]When you comin' home dad, I \[G]don't know when
\[D]We'll get together \[E]then,
\[G]You know we'll have a good time \[E]then
\endchorus

\beginverse
My son turned ten just the other day
He said Thanks for the ball dad, come on, let's play
Could you teach me to throw?, I said Not today
I got a lot to do, he said That's OK
He walked away with a smile on his face, he said
I'm gonna be like him, yeah,
you know I'm gonna be like him
\endverse


\beginchorus
And the cats in the cradle...
\endchorus

\beginverse
Well, he came home from college just the other day
So much like a man I just had to say
Son, I'm proud of you, can you sit for a while?
He shook his head and said with a smile
What I'd really like, Dad, is to borrow the car keys
See you later, can I have them please?
\endverse

\beginchorus
And the cats in the cradle...
\endchorus

\beginverse
I've long since retired, my son's moved away
I called him up just the other day
I said, I'd like to see you if you don't mind
He said, I'd love to, Dad, if I can find the time
You see my new job's a hassle and kids have the flu
But it's sure nice talking to you, Dad
It's been sure nice talking to you
\endverse

\beginverse
And as I \[D]hung up the phone it occurred to me
He'd \[G]grown up just like \[E]me
My \[G]boy was just like \[E]me
