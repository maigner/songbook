\beginverse
H\[C]ey there, people, I'm bobby brown
They s\[Am]ay Im the cutest boy in town
My c\[Dm7]ar is fast, my teeth is shiney
I t\[G]ell all the girls they can kiss my heinie
Here I am at a famous school
Im dressin sharp and im Actin cool
I got a cheerleader here wants to help with my paper
Let her do all the work n maybe later I'll rape her
\endverse


\beginchorus
Oh G\[F]od I am the american dream
I d\[Em]o not think Im t\[Am]oo extreme
An Im a h\[Dm7]andsome sonofab\[G]itch
Im gonna get a good job n be real rich (get a good...)
\endchorus


\beginverse \chordsoff
Women's liberation
Came creeping across the nation
I tell you people I was not ready
When I fucked this dyke by the name of freddie
She made a little speech then,
Aw, she tried to make me say when
She had my balls in a vice, but she left the dick
I guess it's still hooked on, but now it shoots too quick
\endverse


\beginchorus
Oh G\[F]od I am the american dream
But n\[Em]ow I smell like v\[Am]aseline
An Im a m\[Dm7]iserable sonofab\[G]itch
Am I a boy or a lady...i don't know which (I wonder wonder...)
\endchorus

\beginverse \chordsoff
So I went out n bought me a leisure suit
I jingle my change, but Im still kinda cute
Got a job doin radio promo
An none of the jocks can even tell Im a homo
Eventually me n a friend
Sorta drifted along into s\&m
I can take about an hour on the tower of power
Long as I gets a little golden shower
\endverse


\beginchorus \chordsoff
Oh God I am the american dream
With a spindle up my butt till it makes me scream
An I'll do anything to get ahead
I lay awake nights sayin, thank you, fred!
Oh god, oh god, Im so fantastic!
Thanks to freddie, Im a sexual spastic
And my name is bobby brown
Watch me now, Im goin down,
And my name is bobby brown
Watch me now, Im goin down, etc.
\endchorus
