\beginverse
Tommy used to work on the docks
Union's been on strike, he's down on his luck
It's tough, so tough
\endverse

\beginverse
Gina works the diner all day
Working for her man, she brings home her pay
For love, mmm, for love
\endverse

\beginverse
She says we've got to hold on to what we've got
It doesn't make a difference if we make it or not
We got each other and that's a lot
For love we'll give it a shot!

\endverse

\beginchorus
Oh, we're half way there
Oh oh, livin' on a prayer
Take my hand, we'll make it I swear
Oh oh, livin' on a prayer
\endchorus

\beginverse
Tommy's got his six string in hock
Now he's holding in what he used to make it talk
So tough, mmm, it's tough
\endverse

\beginverse
Gina dreams of running away
When she cries in the night, Tommy whispers
``Baby it's okay, someday''
\endverse

\beginverse
We gotta hold on to what we've got
It doesn't make a difference if we make it or not
We got each other and that's a lot
For love we'll give it a shot!
\endverse

\beginchorus
Oh, we're half way there
Oh oh, livin' on a prayer
Take my hand, we'll make it I swear
Oh oh, livin' on a prayer! 

Livin' on a prayer!
\endchorus

\beginchorus
We gotta hold on ready or not
You live for the fight when it's all that you've got

Whoa, we're half way there
Whoa oh, livin' on a prayer
Take my hand and we'll make it I swear
Whoa oh, livin' on a prayer
\endchorus
