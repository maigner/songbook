\beginsong{I will survive}[by={Cake}]

\beginverse\memorize
At f\[Am]irst I was afraid. I was p\[Dm]etrified.
I kept thinking \[G]I could never live without you b\[C]y my side.
But then I sp\[Fmaj7]ent so many nights just thinking h\[Dsus2]ow you'd done me wrong.
I grew str\[E]ong. I learned h\[E7]ow to get along.
\endverse

\beginverse
And so you're b^ack from outer sp^ace.
I just walked ^in to find you here without that l^ook upon your face.
I should have ch^anged my fucking lock. I would have m^ade you leave your key
If I'd have kn^own for just one second you'd be b^ack to bother me. 
\endverse

\beginverse
Oh now g^o. Walk out the d^oor.
Just turn ar^ound now. You're not w^elcome anymore.
^Weren't you the one who tried to br^eak me with desire?
Did you think I'd cr^umble? Did you think I'd l^ay down and die?

\endverse

\beginchorus
Oh not ^I.  I will surv^ive.
As l^ong as I know how to love I kn^ow I'll be alive.
I've got ^all my life to live. I've got ^all my love to give.
I will surv^ive. I will surv^ive. 
\endchorus

\beginverse
It took ^all the strength I had just not to f^all apart.
I'm trying h^ard to mend the pieces of my br^oken heart.
And I spent ^oh so many nights just feeling s^orry for myself.
I used to ^cry. But now I h^old my head up high. 
\endverse

\beginverse
And you'll s^ee me with ^ somebody new.
I'm not that st^upid little person still in l^ove with you.
And so you th^ought you'd just drop by, and you exp^ect me to be free.
But now I'm s^aving all my lovin' for some^one who's lovin' me. 
\endverse

\beginverse
Oh now g^o. Walk out the d^oor.
Just turn ar^ound now. You're not w^elcome anymore.
^Weren't you the one who tried to br^eak me with desire?
Did you think I'd cr^umble? Did you think I'd l^ay down and die?
\endverse

\beginchorus
Oh not ^I.  I will surv^ive.
As l^ong as I know how to love I kn^ow I'll be alive.
I've got ^all my life to live. I've got ^all my love to give.
I will surv^ive. I will surv^ive.
