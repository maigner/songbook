\beginsong{Wish You Were Here}[
	by={Pink\ Floyd}]

\beginverse
\[C]So, so you think you can t\[D]ell,
Heaven from H\[Am]ell, blue skies from p\[G]ain.
Can you tell a green f\[D]ield from a cold steel r\[C]ail, a smile from a v\[Am]eil,
Do you think you can t\[G]ell?
\endverse

\beginverse
And did they get you to tr\[C]ade your heroes for gh\[D]osts,
Hot ashes for tr\[Am]ees, hot air for a c\[G]ool breeze, cold comfort for ch\[D]ange,
And did you exch\[C]ange a walk on part in the w\[Am]ar for a lead role in a c\[G]age?
\endverse

\beginchorus
\[C] How I wish, how I wish you were h\[D]ere.
We're just \[Am]two lost souls swimming in a fish bowl, \[G] year after year,
\[D] Running over the same old ground. \[C] What have we found?
The same old f\[Am]ears. Wish you were h\[G]ere!
\endchorus
