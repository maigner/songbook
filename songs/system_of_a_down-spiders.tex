The piercing radiant moon, 
The storming of poor June, 
All the life running through her hair
\endverse

\beginverse
Approaching guiding light, 
Our shallow years in fright, 
Dreams are made winding through my head
\endverse

\beginchorus
Through my h\[C]ead, through my head \[D5]
Bef\[C]ore you kn\[B&5]ow, \[A5] Awake\[D5]
\endchorus

\beginverse
Your lives are open wide, 
The V-chip gives them sight, 
All the life running through her hair
\endverse

\beginverse
The spiders all in tune, 
The evening of the moon, 
Dreams are made winding through my head
\endverse

\beginchorus
Through my head, through my head 
Before you know, Awake

Through my head, through my head
Before you know, 
Before you know I will be waiting all awake,

Dreams are made winding through her hair,
