\beginverse
As I was goin' over the Cork and Kerry Mountains
I saw Captain Farrell and his money, he was countin'
I first produced my pistol and then produced my rapier
I said, ``Stand and deliver or the devil he may take ya''
\endverse

\beginverse
I took all of his money and it was a pretty penny
I took all of his money, yeah, and I brought it home to Molly
She swore that she loved me, no, never would she leave me
But the devil take that woman, yeah, for you know she tricked me easy
\endverse

\beginchorus
Musha rain dum a doo, dum a da
Whack for my daddy, oh
Whack for my daddy, oh
There's whiskey in the jar, oh
\endchorus

\beginverse
Being drunk and weary I went to Molly's chamber
Takin' Molly with me but I never knew the danger
For about six or maybe seven, yeah, in walked Captain Farrell
I jumped up, fired my pistols and I shot him with both barrels
\endverse

\beginchorus
Musha rain dum a doo, dum a da...
Solo:
\endchorus

\beginverse
Now some men like a fishin' but some men like the fowlin'
Some men like to hear, to hear the cannonball roarin'
But me, I like sleepin', especially in my Molly's chamber
But here I am in prison, here I am with a ball and chain, yeah
\endverse

\beginchorus
Musha rain dum a doo, dum a da...
\endchorus
