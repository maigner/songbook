\beginverse
\[Dm]We get some rules to follow
That and this, these and th\[A]ose
\[C#] No one kn\[Dm]ows
\endverse

\beginverse
We get these pills to swallow
How they stick in your throat
Taste like gold
Oh what you do to me
No one knows
\endverse

\beginchorus
I realize you’re mine
Indeed a fool am I
I realize you’re mine
Indeed a fool am I
\endchorus

\beginverse
I journey through the desert
Of the mind with no hope
I follow
\endverse

\beginverse
I drift along the ocean
Dead lifeboat in the sun
And come undone
Pleasantly caving in
I come undone
\endverse

\beginchorus
I realize you’re mine
Indeed a fool am I
I realize you’re mine
Indeed a fool am I
\endchorus

\beginverse
Heaven smiles above me
What a gift here below
But no one knows
The gift that you give to me
No one knows
\endverse
