The s\[C]ilicon chip ins\[Em]ide her head, Gets sw\[F]itched to overl\[G]oad
And n\[C]obody’s gonna go to sch\[Em]ool today, She’s gonna m\[F]ake them stay at \[G]home
And d\[F]addy doesn’t underst\[G]and it, He always s\[C]aid she was good as g\[F]old
And he can s\[F]ee no reasons, 'Cos there \[F]are no reasons
What r\[F]eason do you need to be sh\[G]ow-ow-ow-ow-own?
\endverse


\beginchorus
Tell me \[C]why I don’t like M\[Em]ondays
Tell me \[F]why I don’t like M\[G]ondays
Tell me \[C]why I don’t like M\[Em]ondays
I wanna sh\[F]oo\[G]t the whole day d\[C]own \[Em] \[F] \[G] \[F]

\beginverse
The T\[C]elex machine is k\[Em]ept so clean, And it t\[F]ypes to a waiting w\[G]orld
And m\[C]other feels so shocked, Father’s w\[Em]orld is rocked
And their th\[F]oughts turn to their \[G]own little girl
Sw\[F]eet 16 ain’t that p\[G]eachy keen
Now that \[C]ain’t so neat to \[F]admit defeat
They can s\[F]ee no reasons, 'Cuz there \[F]are no reasons
What r\[F]easons do you n\[G]eed? Oh Oh oh whoa whoa
\endverse


\beginchorus
Tell me why I don’t like Mondays, 
Tell me why I don’t like Mondays
Tell me why  I don’t like Mondays 
I wanna shoot The whole day d\[Em]own, down, down, shoot it all d\[C]own \[Em] \[F] \[G] \[F]
\endchorus

\beginverse
And all the pl\[C]aying's stopped in the pl\[Em]ayground now
She w\[F]ants to play with the t\[G]oys a while
And sch\[C]ool's out early and s\[Em]oon we'll be learning
And the l\[F]esson today is h\[G]ow to die
And then the b\[F]ullhorn crackles, And the c\[G]aptain tackles
(With the pr\[C]oblems of the how's and wh\[F]y's)
And he can s\[F]ee no reasons, 'Cos there \[F]are no reasons
What r\[F]eason do you need to d\[G]ie, die? Oh Oh Oh
\endverse


\beginchorus
Tell me \[C]why I don’t like M\[Em]ondays
Tell me \[F]why I don’t like M\[G]ondays
Tell me \[C]why I don’t like, \[Em] I don’t like 
(Tell me \[F]why) I don’t like M\[G]ondays
Tell me \[C]why I don’t like, \[Em] I don’t like 
(Tell me w\[F]hy) I don’t like M\[G]ondays
Tell me \[C]why I don't like M\[Em]ondays
I wanna sh\[F]oot\[G] the whole day d\[C]own 
\endchorus
