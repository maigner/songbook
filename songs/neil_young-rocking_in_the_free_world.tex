\beginverse
I see a girl in the night
With a baby in her hand
Under an old street light
Near a garbage can
\endverse
\beginverse
Now she puts the kid away and she's gone to get a hit
She hates her life and what she's done to it
That's one more kid that will never go to school
Never get to fall in love never get to be cool
\endverse

\beginverse
We got a thousand points of light
For the homeless man
We got a kinder gentler machine gun hand

\endverse

\beginverse
We got department stores and toilet paper
Got styrophone boxes for the ozone layer
Got a man of the people says keep hope alive
Got fuel to burn got roads to drive
