\[C]Shed a tear cause I'm missing you
I'm \[G]still allright to smile
\[A]Girl I think about you every\[D]day now

\[C]Was a time when I wasn't sure
But you \[G]set my mind at ease
\[A]There is no doubt, you're in my \[D]heart now

\[C]Sad woman t\[G]ake it slow
It'll w\[C]ork itself out f\[Em]ine                   
\[C]All we need is j\[G]ust a little p\[D]atience

Sad sugar make it slow and
and we'll come together fine
All we need is just a little patience
\endchorus

\beginverse
Sit here on the stairs
Cause I'd rather be alone
If I can't have you right now
I'll wait dear

Sometimes, I get so tense
But I can't speed up the time
But you know love, there's one more thing to consider
\endverse

\beginchorus
Sad woman take it slow. Things will be just fine
You and I just use a little patience

Sad sugar take the time, Cause the lights are shining bright
You and I've got what it takes to make it



\[D]We don't fake it \[D]Ahh and never break it
\[D]Cause I can't take it  (Solo)

\endchorus



\beginverse
 
\[G]A little \[D]patience, Mhh Yeah
I've been walking these streets tonight. Just trying to get it right
It's hard to see with so many around, you know I don't like being stuck in a crowd
And the streets don't change but maybe the name, I ain't got time for the game
Cause I need you, Yeah Yeah cause I need you
Uh I \[F]need you, Woh I \[G]need you, Uhh this \[D]time
\endverse
