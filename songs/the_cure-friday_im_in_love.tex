\beginverse
\[Bm9]Dressed up to the \[G]eyes, it's a wonderful surpr\[D]ise
To see your sh\[A]oes and your spirits r\[Bm9]ise
Throwing out your fr\[G]own and just smiling at the s\[D]ound
And as sleek as a shr\[A]iek spinning round and r\[Bm9]ound
Always take a big b\[G]ite, it's such a gorgeous s\[D]ight
To see you \[A]eat in the middle of the n\[Bm9]ight
You can never get en\[G]ough, enough of this st\[D]uff
It's Friday \[A]I'm in love
\endverse
